# Script — LOCKED v4 (2026-07-19)

v4 changes ONLY s7_recap, per user request — end on persistence: "So: the
Minion sniffs, the gateway routes, Kafka carries, the enricher parses and
enriches — and every flow is persisted in ClickHouse, to answer queries
later. Delta V flows, explained." (30 words, measured 11.93 s; total
narration 80.67 s → video 85.12 s.)

# Script — LOCKED v3 (2026-07-18) [superseded]

v3 reframes the video as "Delta-V flows, explained" — telemetryd removed
entirely per the SME ("We shouldn't mention Telemetryd in the Flows
conversation"). Scenes 1, 2, 6, 7 rewritten; 3–5 unchanged from v2.
Measured narration 78.40 s → total 82.85 s.

| Scene | v3 narration (TTS text, verbatim) | Words |
|-------|-----------------------------------|-------|
| s1_hook | How does Delta V turn a raw flow packet into a queryable record? Three steps, one pipeline — starting at the network edge. | 22 |
| s2_context | Every flow — Netflow five and nine, I P Fix, s Flow — rides the same three step pipeline: the Minion listens, the gateway routes, the enricher makes sense of it. Kafka connects the stages. | 34 |
| s6_meaning | The payoff: the coupling is content blind — only the enricher understands flows. And scaling is pure Kafka: four partitions per topic, and consumer groups spread them — enricher replicas and ClickHouse's consumer threads alike. | 35 |
| s7_recap | So: the Minion sniffs, the gateway routes, Kafka carries, the enricher parses and enriches, and ClickHouse answers the queries. Delta V flows, explained. | 24 |

s6 rationale: the SME clarified the partition scaling is "pure Kafka" —
the broker's 4 partitions per topic let any consumer group spread work,
including ClickHouse's 4 consumer threads per topic; the narration now
attributes it to Kafka rather than to any one service's design.

# Script — LOCKED v2 (2026-07-18) [superseded]

Revision history: v1 locked 2026-07-17. v2 changes ONLY s5_step3, per SME
feedback (SME): the enricher does not write to ClickHouse directly — it is
an SCS processor that produces enriched flows to the `deltav-flows` Kafka
topic, which ClickHouse ingests with its own Kafka consumer.

v2 s5_step3 (32 words, measured 14.38 s): "Step three, the flow enricher.
One Spring Cloud Stream binding consumes all four topics, parses each
protocol, adds node context, and publishes enriched flows back to Kafka —
ClickHouse's own consumer ingests them."

Original v1 script below for the record; all other scenes unchanged.

TTS column uses spaced acronyms ("U D P", "g R P C", "telemetry d");
on-screen text uses real spellings (UDP, gRPC, telemetryd).
186 words → ≈73 s narration → ≈78 s total with breathing room.

| Scene | Narration (TTS text, verbatim) | Words |
|-------|-------------------------------|-------|
| s1_hook | When a router sends a flow packet into Delta V, which service actually processes it? Here's the surprise: it isn't telemetry d. | 22 |
| s2_context | Delta V still ships telemetry d, but as a hollowed out shell: all eight of its queues are disabled. The real pipeline bypasses it entirely, in three steps. | 28 |
| s3_step1 | Step one, the Minion. One U D P port, four seven two nine, receives all four flow protocols. A four byte version sniff tells them apart; nothing else is parsed. | 30 |
| s4_step2 | Step two, the gateway. Each protocol streams over its own g R P C method, and lands on its own Kafka topic, keyed by location and Minion I D. | 29 |
| s5_step3 | Step three, the flow enricher. One Spring Cloud Stream binding consumes all four topics, parses each protocol, adds node context, and writes flow documents to ClickHouse. | 26 |
| s6_meaning | The payoff: the coupling is content blind — only the enricher understands flows. And scaling is just replicas: Kafka spreads sixteen partitions across the group, with no code or config changes. | 31 |
| s7_recap | So: Minion, gateway, Kafka, enricher, ClickHouse. Telemetry d keeps its seat for future protocols — but today, it just watches the traffic go by. | 24 |
