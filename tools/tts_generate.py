"""Generate generic per-scene explainer narration WAVs with Kokoro.

After its model files are cached, Kokoro-82M inference runs locally without a
network connection. This template writes one 24 kHz WAV per scene plus a
``durations.json`` manifest from which composition timing can be derived.

Replace every placeholder in ``SCENE_NARRATIONS`` before running. Budget
approximately 2.55 words/second at speed 1.1. Spell out or space acronyms as
needed for pronunciation; on-screen text can retain its normal spelling.
